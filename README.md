Startup Funding Data Analysis (Data Analysis)

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Analyse the dataset on the 'Funding to the startups' and draw valuable insights from it.

DESCRIPTION:
Startup funding — or startup capital — is the money needed to launch a new business. It can come from a variety of sources and can be used for any purpose that helps the startup go from idea to actual business. Our task is to analyse the trend of this funding.
